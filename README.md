reMember
========

Member Administration tool written in Javascript with Nodejs, Express. Mongo and Angularjs.
See the blog posts [here](http://www.thebuttonfactory.nl).

This is a work in progress and an attempt to see if I can replace ASP.NET and C# for Node and NPM.

### Install

```cd reMember/server```

Use NPM to install dependencies : ```npm install reMember/server```

Then use Bower to install frontend frameworks: ```bower install angular angular-route angular-resource bootstrap```
